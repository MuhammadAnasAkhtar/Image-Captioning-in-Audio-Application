# Image Captioning with Audio Narration
# Overview
This application generates captions for input images using an AI-powered image captioning model and converts these captions into audio narration. It combines image-to-text and text-to-speech technologies to provide a seamless experience.

# Features
Image Captioning:

Automatically generates a textual description for the input image.
Powered by the Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-large model.
Audio Narration:

Converts the generated caption into audio using the kakao-enterprise/vits-ljs model.
Returns the narration as a downloadable .wav file.
User-Friendly Interface:

Built with Gradio for an intuitive and interactive experience.
# How It Works
Upload an Image: Provide an image to the application.
Caption Generation: The model generates a descriptive caption for the image.
Audio Narration: The caption is converted into speech and saved as a .wav file.
